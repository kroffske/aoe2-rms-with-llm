# Intake & Confirm

Before starting any task:

1. **Dictation** - User describes task (voice/text)
2. **Rephrase** - Claude rephrases understanding
3. **Confirm** - User approves scope
4. **Lock** - Scope is fixed, no scope creep

## Link to understand skill

For complex tasks, use `/understand` skill to get detailed confirmation.

## Anti-patterns

- Starting work before confirm
- Expanding scope mid-task
- Assuming requirements
